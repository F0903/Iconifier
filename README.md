# Iconifier

A blazingly fast, small, and convenient program for converting .png images to .ico icons.

Usage is as simple as can be, simply drag an image onto the program and viola! The image is converted so fast you probably didn't event spot the program launching.

Be aware that the program only supports images with a max size of 256x256. This is a limitation of Windows, which isn't something I can do anything about.

Binaries can be found in the latest build action for convenience :)

For library usage, use the custom libary made for it called [ico-rs](https://github.com/F0903/ico-rs)
